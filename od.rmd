## Three games with dice

This is an Challenging game where you are to compute the probability of rolling a given number obtained by summing the numbers on a roll of dice. 

### Game one  

Each die has 6 sides (it is a cube) however the distribution of the numbers on the dice is not uniform.  

die number one has these 6 numbers  0,1,2,2,3,4  
die number two has 1,1,2,3,3,4  
die number three has 1,1,1,2,3,4  

It should be easy to see that any number from 2 to 12 is a possibility.  

Determine the probability of rolling a seven?


We approach thru repeated random sampling by setting  
up our three dice as d1, d2, and d3. And then we roll them using "sample"" and add them up. Every time we roll we put the result in as the next element of an array we have named "count". Finally the "table" command issued on the array  "count" gives us the information we seek. The probability of rolling 7 is the number in the count table divided by the length of the array "count" -- 10,000 in this case.

```{r}
d1=c(0,1,2,2,3,4)
d2=c(1,1,2,3,3,4)
d3=c(1,1,1,2,3,4)
count=numeric()

for (i in 1:10000){
  s1=sample(d1,size=1)
   s2=sample(d2,size=1)
    s3=sample(d3,size=1)
    count[i]=sum(s1,s2,s3)
}
table(count)
```


### Game two

you have two standard dice  
both have 6 sides 

Determine the probability of rolling a seven?  


We note there are `r 6*6` possibilities each equally likely. So we simply compute each and summarize with the R function table()

```{r}
die_1=c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
die_2=c(1,2,3,4,5,6)

result=rep(0,times=6*6)
dim(result)=c(6,6)
for (i in 1:6){
  for (j in 1:6){
    
 result[i,j] = die_1[i] + die_2[j] 
    }
  }

smry=table(as.numeric(result))
smry
names(smry)
```
So we conclude the probabilities of rolling a seven is  
```{r}
tst=as.list(smry)
tst$`7`/(6*6)

```



### Game three  

You have three dice.Each die has four sides (they look like little pyramids).
They each have the numbers 1,2,3, and 4 on their respective faces. When you roll them it is the number that is face down that you count.  In this setup the possible outcomes are the numbers from 3 throughn 12.  
Determine the probability of rolling a seven? 

### Final Summary

List in decreasing order the probability of rolling a seven and what you determined those probabilities to be.
